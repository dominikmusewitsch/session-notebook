Step 1: Go to folder that shall become a git repository. Inside this folder, turn the folder into a git repository with the command git init.

Step 2: Create a new empty remote repository also called [whatever you want] in your Github account.

Step 3: Copy the SSH repository address, e.g., git@github.com:<your-github-name>/web-challenges.git, and add it as the remote repository "origin" to our local [whatever you want] repository (a repository can be linked to multiple remote repositories, so we need to give them nicknames to distinguish them; "origin" is the standard name for the main remote repository):

git remote add origin <ssh link>

Check if the remote repository was successfully linked with the command:

git remote -v

A "fetch" and a "push" address should be printed to the terminal.

Step 4: Use git add <challenge folder name> to stage the changes from this challenge

Step 5:Commit these challenge files with git commit -m "<message>" and add a meaningful message, e.g., "add solution for html and the web - personal website".
